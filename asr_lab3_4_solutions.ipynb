    "**Note:** The output of `backtrace()` is the sequence of output labels on the best path. Depending on the structure of your WFST, this could be phones, words or a mix of both.  In the assignment, you will be calculating error rate at the word level, so think you should choose your WFST outputs appropriately.  You might like to review the [Lab 1 solutions](https://github.com/Ore-an/asr_lab1/blob/master/asr_lab1_solutions.ipynb), including the suggested additional exercises at the bottom."
